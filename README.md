## 🎯 Overview

Alternun bridges real-world gold reserves with decentralized regenerative finance, creating a paradigm where tangible underground gold underlies digital tokens that fund environmental impact projects.

**Key Innovation**: Instead of extracting gold, we tokenize verified underground reserves to preserve the environment while unlocking capital for sustainability initiatives.

### The Problem We Solve
- 💰 Gold extraction is environmentally destructive
- 🌍 Regenerative projects struggle to access capital
- 🏦 Traditional finance lacks transparency in asset backing
- 📊 Communities near reserves don't benefit from their resources

### Our Solution
1. **Tokenize Underground Gold**: Verified reserves (NI 43-101 standard) become GBT tokens
2. **Fund Impact Projects**: Token sales finance solar farms, reforestation, sustainable agriculture
3. **Community Participation**: Local communities earn equity tokens (ePT) by supporting projects
4. **Transparent Backing**: Every token is backed by verifiable gold reserves

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Blockchain**: Celo (EVM-compatible L1)
- **Language**: Solidity ^0.8.24
- **Framework**: Hardhat + TypeScript
- **Token Standard**: ERC-20
- **Upgradeability**: OpenZeppelin UUPS Proxies
- **Treasury Token**: USDT (Phase 1) → xAUT/Tether Gold (Phase 2)

### Smart Contracts

#### Core Tokens
1. **GBT Token** - Gold-Backed Token (7 decimals)
   - Backed 1:1 by verified underground gold reserves
   - Mintable only when new reserves are verified
   - Burnable if reserves are re-evaluated

2. **pGBT Token** - Potential Gold-Backed Token
   - Represents reserves under verification
   - Convertible to GBT upon full verification
   - Higher risk profile during verification period

3. **ePT Token** - Environmental Project Token
   - Issued to project supporters
   - Governance voting rights
   - Impact tracking credential

#### Core Contracts
4. **Treasury Manager** (Upgradeable)
   - Manages protocol reserves (USDT → xAUT migration ready)
   - Enforces 50/30/20 split: Projects/Recovery/Alternun
   - Validates backing ratios

5. **GBT Minter**
   - Mints GBT based on verified reserve capacity
   - Implements weighted reserve categories (NI 43-101)
   - Oracle integration for gold pricing
   - 2% minting fee, 80% commercial factor

6. **Project Vaults**
   - Manages regenerative project lifecycle
   - Handles staking/unstaking of GBT
   - Tracks debt and profit distribution
   - Issues ePT tokens at 50% debt threshold

7. **Oracle** (Mock for testing, Chainlink for production)
   - Provides gold/USD price feeds
   - Critical for mint calculations

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js >= 18.x
- npm or yarn
- Git

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/alternun-development/alternun-celo.git
cd alternun-celo

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your private key and API keys

# Compile contracts
npm run compile

# Run tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### Deployment

#### Testnet (Alfajores)
```bash
npm run deploy:alfajores
```

#### Mainnet (Celo)
```bash
npm run deploy:celo
```

### Contract Verification
```bash
# Alfajores
npm run verify:alfajores -- DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS "Constructor Args"

# Mainnet
npm run verify:celo -- DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS "Constructor Args"
```

## 📊 Tokenomics

### GBT (Gold-Backed Token)
- **Decimals**: 7 (to represent grams * 10,000)
- **Backing**: Verified underground gold reserves
- **Minting**: Only through verified reserve increases
- **Minimum Mint**: 1 gram

### Reserve Categories (NI 43-101 Standard)
| Category | Weight | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Proven Reserves | 70% | Highest confidence, ready for extraction |
| Probable Reserves | 50% | High confidence, needs more study |
| Measured Resources | 60% | Detailed sampling completed |
| Indicated Resources | 30% | Reasonable confidence level |
| Inferred Resources | 15% | Limited sampling, lowest confidence |

**Capacity Formula**:
```
Capacity = Σ(Category Amount × Weight × Commercial Factor) / 10,000
```

### Treasury Split
- **50%** → Project Funding Pool
- **30%** → Recovery Pool (backup/insurance)
- **20%** → Alternun Treasury (8% to mine owners, rest operational)

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test file
npx hardhat test test/GBTToken.test.ts

# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Run gas reporter
REPORT_GAS=true npm test
```
